# Lab6CA

This lab aimed to have us learn about how ROM works, why a processor needs it, and how to implement it in a program. This program contains a set of instructions hard-coded to the file. In the file, each time the address increments by 4 a new instruction is outputted. This is a very important part of the future processor design project and will be critical to its function.
